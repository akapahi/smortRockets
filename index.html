			<h3> About </h3>
			<p>Each of these rockets contains a DNA or a set of genes which tells it how to move. Their objective is to get to the target within their lifespan of 400ms. After
				every 400ms a new generation is created by combining genes from two members from the previous generation. The most fit members have a greater chance to reproduce.
				Fitness is defined by how close the rocket gets to the target. Slowly over generations they'll learn to get to the target while avoiding obstacles.</p>
